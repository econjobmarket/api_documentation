## Legacy Api

This page provides links to the documentation of the legacy api, which applies to the database prior to July 2018.  
It still works with the new database. However if you are just establishing a connection, it is recommended 
that you use the updated methods in the [new api](../api/Api-Documents.0.md).

1. [Soap-Http](soap_http)
    * [Php Soap](php_soap)

3. [Data Methods](data_objects)
    + [Data/GetData](getdata)
    + [Applicant Method](applicant_method)
    + [Applicant Details](applicant_details)
    + [Questions/Answers](questions_answers)
