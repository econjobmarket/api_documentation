## Econjobmarket Documentation

This site provides various kinds of documentation for [econjobmarket.org](https://econjobmarket.org). All of the data on this site is available on [Github](https://github.com/econjobmarket) as part of the econjobmarket collection.

Econjobmarket has an api which allows authorized recruiters to download their application information.   This data can be fed into a local recruiting system, or used to develop a custom management system.  The links to that documentation appear in the sidebar of the website [https://support.econjobmarket.org](https://support.econjobmarket.org). 

There are a few code repositories in the econjobmarket collection on github.

1. [Code to redisplay the open ads on econjobmarket](https://github.com/econjobmarket/ad-display)  (javascript) written by Shervin Tari.
1. [Download all your applications](https://github.com/download_script) (php) requires an econjobmarket recruiter account for access, and requires some initialization steps at [http://backend.econjobmarket.org](https://backend.econjobmarket.org).

More code will be added as time permits.
