# Backup Using Zifiles

If you just want to backup your existing applications, you can do so using the website without needing to use the api.

To do so visit [https://backend.econjobmarket.org](https://backend.econjobmarket.org).  On the top left of the page there is a button that says `Login with Econjobmarket` and you should click on that.  This will bring up a login screen connected to the main website at [Econjobmarket.org](https://econjobmarket.org).  You can login with your recruiter credentials.  At the moment the only logins this allows are for recruiters - you can't use it if you are an applicant or recommender.

Once your login is accepted, you will see the recruiter home page for the site.  If you have not configured your api, you will see a big button that says `Get Started`.  You don't need to do this is you just want a backup file.

Instead, look on the lowest link on the right hand menu.  It will say `EJM Api Details for your organization`.  Click on that.  Now, at there will be a new link on on the bottom of the right hand menu called `Active Positions`.   Click on that one and you see a list of your un-retired positions, and if you have any, previous backup files you have saved.

To create a new backup, choose the position you are interested in and click the link that says `Backup $n Applications`.  The link will start the back up process in the background. 

The backup process can take quite a bit of time.  My last check took over two minutes to create a backup of 640 applications.  Once you get the success message at the top, you just have to wait.  Reload the page after a couple of minutes and you will see the backup you just requested in the list of backup files.
