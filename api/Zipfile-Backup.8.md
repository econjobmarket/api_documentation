## Backup Using Zipfiles

The recommended way to backup your data is to use the backup feature on [econjobmarket.org](https://econjobmarket.org).

Once you login at econjobmarket as a recruiter, follow the link [https://econjobmarket.org/organization/postings](https://econjobmarket.org/organization/postings) and look for the position whose applicant data you would like to backup.  On the right hand side of the page, look for the header `Applications`, then click on the link that shows the number of applications you have collected.
