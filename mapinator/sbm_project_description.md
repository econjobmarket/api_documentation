# Estimation Summary

### Author: James Yuming Yu, Vancouver School of Economics, 1 August 2021

This estimation constructs a hierarchical classification of economics institutions
based on placement outcomes of their Ph.D. graduates and hires.

Institutions are grouped together based on having similar placement
rates to other institutions.

Much of the data comes from the 2020 and 2021 VSE Workathons, 3-day
events where groups of volunteers worked 10 hours per day to manually
record placement outcomes. The workathons expanded the global coverage
of the data.

The estimate yields the following four groups:

These types graduate job market applicants according to the following matrix:
<pre>
            From: Type 1 Type 2 Type 3 Type 4
        To Type 1 568    109    23     10
        To Type 2 586    258    87     21
        To Type 3 762    681    350    58
        To Type 4 136    197    94     88
To Other Academic 306    273    170    87
    To Government 358    274    117    23
To Private Sector 460    225    89     11
To Teaching Univs 434    587    435    152

</pre>

To read this, take the column label and the row label of a specific cell

(e.g. Column for Type 2, Row for Type 1).

Then "The sum of all graduates from Type 2 institutions that were hired
as assistant professors anywhere in Type 1 institutions is 109". 109 is
the (2, 1) column-row pair.

--------------------

The placements for the four types are those of assistant professors.

Other Academic is any academic institution hiring positions other
than assistant professor (e.g. lecturer).

Government is any government institution e.g. central banks.

Private Sector is any private institution e.g. Amazon.

Teaching Universities is any institution that hires assistant professors but doesn't graduate any Ph.D.s.

--------------------

The types are ordered such that higher types place more
often to lower types than lower types place to higher
types.

e.g. Take Type 2. Type 2 has 109 placements upward to type 1, but type 1 has 586 placements downward to type 2.

109 < 586 so between type 1 and type 2, it is easier to be
placed downward than upward.
